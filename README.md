Chrome has recently started blocking the stylesheets, thus breaking the editor: 

"Access to CSS stylesheet at 'http://cdn.tinymce.com/4/skins/lightgray/content.min.css' from origin 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

This is an attempt to fix that by using: importcss plugin.
